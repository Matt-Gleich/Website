            Hello and welcome to my website! Since January of 2019 when I
            started programming I&apos;ve been working and learning in public on
            GitHub. From design to development I love the entire process of
            building software. Since I started programming I&apos;ve made a
            hefty amount of PRs (250+) and repositories (130+) working on
            everything from CI/CD automation software to CLI tools and mobile
            apps. I focus on maintainability, performance, and security with all
            of my projects and try to follow a lot of best practices. Following
            best practices early on is the way to go and Iâ€™m a huge supporter of
            it. A large number of my projects have unit tests, almost all have
            linting and CI, and I ensure I am following the best git practices.
            In my free time, I enjoy photography and cycling. Freezing time and
            capturing small amounts of detail is super interesting to me and I
            always enjoy a good cycling adventure.
